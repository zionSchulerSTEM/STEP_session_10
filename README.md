Introduction to Numerical Computing and Computer Algebraic Systems

## The big picture
Although it is important to understand the theory behind algebra, geometry, and calculus, most people trying to apply those concepts in interesting manners resort to computer algebraic systems (like Wolfram, Julia, etc) in order to actually solve problems. This is not because folks simply forget how to perform these operations once they learn how to get computers to do them, but rather that problem solvers must focus significantly on the modelling stage when solving a trivial problem. Often times, creative problems solvers have to take a question, reframe it in a manner that is solvable by a computer, then coding up the model. Also, it can be helpful to know how to use computer algebraic systems when solving homework problems. One could try a problem by hand, then compare their answer with the answer provided by the computer as a means of a sanity check. I recommend that students do this in order to verify their answers.
